# bootstrap4_project

Welcome to the Academy Cinemas Theater page.

This project was created with BootStrap 4.

Some of the key features of this project is its ability to 
redirect users to different parts of the page with the use 
of the navigational links.

This page also shows an example of the use of modal's 
to open images in a seperate screen.

The project also makes use of a contact form which 
gathers a users information for different uses.
